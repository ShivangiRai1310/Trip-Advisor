## INITIALIZING THE PROJECT

* ### Cloning the project into your system

   1. Using Git via cmd
   
       * If you don't have git already installed in your system, get the instructions from here on [how to install git?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/) 
       * Once Git is installed, make an empty folder in your pc, lets say named "dbms".
       * Open your command line and cd into the directory where you have created dbms.
       
         For example:
       
           ```
            cd C:\Users\HP\Documents\dbms
           ```
       * Now to initialize "dbms" as an empty git repository use the following command
          ```
           git init
          ```
       * Now to clone the repository use the command:
          ```
           git clone https://github.com/ShivangiRai1310/dbms.git
          ```
    2) Using GitHub to download a zip
      
       *  You can download a zip from the [GitHub url](https://github.com/ShivangiRai1310/dbms.git).
